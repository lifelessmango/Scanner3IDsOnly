# Scanner3IDsOnly

This is the repo for my public TF2 scanner! A scanner is a tool used to find valuable items in players' backpacks. Simply paste the ids of the players you want to scan in the text box and press the scan button! A list of player ids can be obtained by typing the 'status' command into the console while connected to a server.

Download the current distribution (1.2.3) from the releases tab above.

Note: You have to provide your own steam and backpack.tf API keys (can be obtained at https://steamcommunity.com/dev and http://backpack.tf/developer). The guide (also in the releases tab) explains how to obtain the keys.
